## What does the Plausi Package do?

The Plausi package is designed for R-supported election forensics. It provides functions that enable the identification of statistical irregularities and anomalies in vote results.

Key features include:

- Robust outlier detection for small sample sizes and skewed distributions
- Calculation of differences between all possible combinations of turnout-levels (e.g., for systematic comparison of voter turnout across all voting districts)
- Prediction of expected results using by machine learning algorithms (e.g., yes-vote proportions, voter turnout, etc.)

It serves as a basis for the ___PlausiApp___, which is used for vote result quality controll in different Cantons (TG / SG / ZH).

For the moment, the ___PlausiApp___ is made available upon request via a private Repo (mailto:wahlen@statistik.zh.ch). 

## Licensing
The package is licensed under the MIT license. 

## Project team

# ðŸ—³ Plausi Package

**Predict votes and detect anomalies using R.**

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The Plausi package is designed for R-supported election forensics. It provides functions that enable the identification of statistical irregularities and anomalies in vote results.

Key features include:

- Robust outlier detection for small sample sizes and skewed distributions
- Calculation of differences between all possible combinations of turnout-levels (e.g., for systematic comparison of voter turnout across all voting districts)
- Prediction of expected results using machine learning algorithms (e.g., yes-vote proportions, voter turnout, etc.)

It serves as a basis for the ___PlausiApp___, which is used for vote result quality control in different Cantons (TG / SG / ZH).

For the moment, the ___PlausiApp___ is made available upon request via a private Repo (mailto:wahlen@statistik.zh.ch). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of plausi from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("machinelearningZH/plausi")
```


## Example

Shall we simply reference TLR's vignettes? Or do we need actual examples here? And if we need examples, shall we just quickly run some examples using OGD?

```{r example}
library(plausi)
## basic example code
```


## Licensing
The package is licensed under the MIT license.
